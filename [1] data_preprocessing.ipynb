The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Driving smart cars that drive by themself has it's pros and cons. People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

       "      <td>My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.</td>\n",

The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.       \n",

People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.       \n",

I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME   \n",
       "3  Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME      \n",

These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.    \n",

       "      <td>There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Driving smart cars that drive by themself has it's pros and cons. People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.</td>\n",

The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.       \n",

People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.       \n",

I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME   \n",
       "3  Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME      \n",

These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.    \n",

       "3  dear principal community service should not be required by all students although community service is a wonderful thing service should never be forced i think it shouldn t be required because when students are required to do something they usually don t want to do it and because maybe someone s life really is too busy for it forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it when you are serving others you are doing it to be kind but if you had no option then you re doing it for no reason people are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren t as thankful if they know that serving them wasn t the persons option and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn t have done it teenagers don t like it when they are told what to do it s a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them so naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something they automatically think no way if they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won t get the good feeling people do when you serve others they might dislike it so much that they don t even do service when they re grown up they resent people that tell them they have to do something and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards another reason community service shouldn t be required is because someone might not have time if they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service also someone that doesn t excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades and if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college another example would be someone that isn t good in school but is very talented in sports they would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship therefore community service should be recommended to students not required because when people serve they should do it willingly and if they don t they won t have a good attitude about it teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don t have the time for it thank you for your time student_name   \n",

Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.</td>\n",

Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades.

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.</td>\n",

The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.       \n",

People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.       \n",

I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME   \n",
       "3  Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME      \n",

These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.    \n",

       "3  dear principal community service should not be required by all students although community service is a wonderful thing service should never be forced i think it shouldn t be required because when students are required to do something they usually don t want to do it and because maybe someone s life really is too busy for it forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it when you are serving others you are doing it to be kind but if you had no option then you re doing it for no reason people are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren t as thankful if they know that serving them wasn t the persons option and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn t have done it teenagers don t like it when they are told what to do it s a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them so naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something they automatically think no way if they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won t get the good feeling people do when you serve others they might dislike it so much that they don t even do service when they re grown up they resent people that tell them they have to do something and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards another reason community service shouldn t be required is because someone might not have time if they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service also someone that doesn t excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades and if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college another example would be someone that isn t good in school but is very talented in sports they would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship therefore community service should be recommended to students not required because when people serve they should do it willingly and if they don t they won t have a good attitude about it teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don t have the time for it thank you for your time student_name   \n",

       "      <td>There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Driving smart cars that drive by themself has it's pros and cons. People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME</td>\n",

They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.</td>\n",

The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that \"The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is \"Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that \"It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\"\\n\\nAlso the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text \"The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\"So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.\\n\\nAnd Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example \"Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.       \n",

People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.\\n\\nFirst let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.\\n\\nNow for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.\\n\\nIn my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.       \n",

I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.\\n\\nLook at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME   \n",
       "3  Dear Principal,\\n\\nCommunity service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.\\n\\nForcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.\\n\\nTeenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.\\n\\nAnother reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.\\n\\nTherefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME      \n",

These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.\\n\\nFirst of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.\\n\\nSecond, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.\\n\\nLast, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.\\n\\nThe driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday.    \n",

       "3  dear principal community service should not be required by all students although community service is a wonderful thing service should never be forced i think it shouldn t be required because when students are required to do something they usually don t want to do it and because maybe someone s life really is too busy for it forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it when you are serving others you are doing it to be kind but if you had no option then you re doing it for no reason people are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren t as thankful if they know that serving them wasn t the persons option and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn t have done it teenagers don t like it when they are told what to do it s a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them so naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something they automatically think no way if they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won t get the good feeling people do when you serve others they might dislike it so much that they don t even do service when they re grown up they resent people that tell them they have to do something and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards another reason community service shouldn t be required is because someone might not have time if they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service also someone that doesn t excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades and if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college another example would be someone that isn t good in school but is very talented in sports they would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship therefore community service should be recommended to students not required because when people serve they should do it willingly and if they don t they won t have a good attitude about it teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don t have the time for it thank you for your time student_name   \n",
